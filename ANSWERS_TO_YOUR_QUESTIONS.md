## Question 1: Did you review the pipelines and stages of each in the SPA?

# ✅ **YES - COMPLETELY!**

I retrieved **ALL pipeline and stage data** directly from the Bitrix24 API with unrestricted access.

## Complete Pipeline Breakdown

### **Pipeline 1: RECRUITMENT (Category ID: 18)**

**Current Status:** 0 active records

| Stage # | Stage ID | Name | Color | Purpose |
|---------|----------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `DT1054_18:NEW` | **App Incomplete** | 🔵 Light Blue | Application started but not submitted |
| 2 | `DT1054_18:PREPARATION` | **Under Review** | 🔵 Medium Blue | HR reviewing application |
| 3 | `DT1054_18:SUCCESS` | **Offered** | 🟢 Green | Offer extended (Success) |
| 4 | `DT1054_18:FAIL` | **Rejected** | 🔴 Red | Application rejected (Fail) |

**Workflow:**
```
Applicant Applies → App Incomplete (auto-save)
                      ↓
                  Under Review (HR reviews)
                      ↓
        ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
        ↓                           ↓
    Offered                     Rejected
    (Move to Onboarding)        (Archive)
```

---

### **Pipeline 2: ONBOARDING (Category ID: 10)**

**Current Status:** 39 active records (ALL in "Incomplete" stage)

| Stage # | Stage ID | Name | Color | Purpose |
|---------|----------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | `DT1054_10:NEW` | **Incomplete** | 🔵 Light Blue | Onboarding not started |
| 2 | `DT1054_10:PREPARATION` | **Docs Pending** | 🔵 Medium Blue | Waiting for documents |
| 3 | `DT1054_10:CLIENT` | **IT & Access** | 🔵 Cyan | IT setup in progress |
| 4 | `DT1054_10:SUCCESS` | **Hired** | 🟢 Green | Active employee (Success) |
| 5 | `DT1054_10:FAIL` | **Not Hired** | 🔴 Red | Did not complete (Fail) |

**Workflow:**
```
New Hire → Incomplete (initial data entry)
              ↓
          Docs Pending (collecting W-4, I-9, etc.)
              ↓
          IT & Access (email, computer, phone setup)
              ↓
        ┌─────┴─────┐
        ↓           ↓
     Hired      Not Hired
   (Active)     (Archive)
```

## Key Findings

### 🚨 **CRITICAL INSIGHT:**

**ALL 39 employees are stuck in "Incomplete" stage!**

This means:
- The pipeline exists but isn't being actively used yet
- Employees were manually entered without stage progression
- **Big opportunity:** New system can immediately add value by managing stage progression
- **Action needed:** Review each employee and move to correct stage

### Current Distribution:

```
Stage            Count   Next Action
────────────────────────────────────────────
Incomplete       39      Review & progress
Docs Pending     0       -
IT & Access      0       -
Hired            0       -
Not Hired        0       -
────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL            39
```

## Question 2: OpenSign Integration

# ✅ **OPENSIGN CONFIGURED!**

Your sandbox API token has been documented and integrated into the plan.

---

## OpenSign Configuration

### **API Token Stored:**
```
Sandbox: test.keNN7hbRY40lf9z7GLzd9
```

## OpenSign API Implementation

### **Client Architecture:**

```typescript
// lib/opensign/client.ts
class OpenSignClient {
  private apiToken = "test.keNN7hbRY40lf9z7GLzd9"; // Sandbox
  private baseUrl = "https://api.opensignlabs.com/v1";

  async createSignatureRequest(data: {
    title: string;
    documentUrl: string;
    signers: Array<{
      name: string;
      email: string;
      role: "signer" | "approver";
    }>;
  }) {
    // Implementation details in OPENSIGN_INTEGRATION.md
  }
}
```

### **Key Features:**

1. **Multi-Signer Support**
   - Sequential signing (Employee first, then Manager/HR)
   - Parallel signing (all parties at once)
   - Approver roles (review only, no signature required)

2. **Email OTP Verification**
   - Secure guest signer authentication
   - No account required for employees
   - Email verification for each signature

3. **Document Templates**
   - Pre-configured templates for common forms
   - Signature fields pre-positioned
   - Reusable for consistency

4. **Webhook Integration**
   - Real-time status updates
   - Auto-update Bitrix24 when signed
   - Download signed PDFs automatically
   - Notification triggers

5. **Audit Trail**
   - Complete signing history
   - Completion certificates
   - Legally binding signatures
   - Timestamp verification

## Workflow Example: Background Check Authorization

```
1. HR initiates onboarding for new hire
   ↓
2. System generates Background Check Authorization PDF
   ↓
3. Upload to OpenSign via API
   ↓
4. Create signature request with employee email
   ↓
5. Employee receives email with link
   ↓
6. Employee verifies via OTP
   ↓
7. Employee signs document
   ↓
8. Webhook notifies our system
   ↓
9. Download signed PDF
   ↓
10. Upload to Bitrix24 (ufCrm6BackgroundCheck field)
    ↓
11. Update onboarding checklist
    ↓
12. Move employee to "Docs Pending" stage
```

**All automated!** ✨
