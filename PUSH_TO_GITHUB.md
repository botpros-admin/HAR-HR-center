## 🔐 Choose Your Authentication Method

### Option 1: GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

**Step 1**: Create a Personal Access Token
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Configure:
   - Name: `Hartzell HR Center Deployment`
   - Expiration: 30 days (or as needed)
   - Scopes: Check **`repo`** (Full control of private repositories)
4. Click **Generate token**
5. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

**Step 2**: Push with Token
```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/Agent/Desktop/HR Center"

# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with the token you just copied
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/botpros-admin/HAR-HR-center.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Option 2: GitHub CLI (If you have it installed)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (if not installed)
# Download from: https://cli.github.com/

# Login
gh auth login

# Select: GitHub.com → HTTPS → Authenticate with browser/token

# Push
cd "/mnt/c/Users/Agent/Desktop/HR Center"
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Option 3: SSH Keys (If configured)

```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/Agent/Desktop/HR Center"

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:botpros-admin/HAR-HR-center.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

**Note**: Requires SSH keys set up in GitHub. If not configured, use Option 1 instead.
