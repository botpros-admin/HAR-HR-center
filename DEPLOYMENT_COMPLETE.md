## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ⚡ Quick Smoke Tests (5 minutes)

1. **Test Sticky Column**
   - Navigate to: https://d6457101.hartzell-hr-frontend.pages.dev/admin/employees
   - Scroll right → Employee Name should stay visible ✓

2. **Test Employee Edit**
   - Click "View Details" on any employee
   - Click "Edit Employee"
   - Change email and save
   - Verify change appears immediately (optimistic update) ✓

3. **Test Validation**
   - Try to enter invalid email (e.g., "test")
   - Verify error message appears ✓
   - Enter valid email
   - Verify error clears ✓

### 🔍 Comprehensive Tests (30 minutes)

#### Test 1: Input Validation
```
1. Navigate to employee detail page
2. Click "Edit Employee"
3. Test each field type:
   - Email: Enter "invalid" → Should show error
   - Phone: Enter "abc123" → Should show error
   - Date: Click date field → Should show calendar picker
   - Required fields: Clear firstName → Should show error
4. Fix all errors and save → Should succeed
```

#### Test 2: Optimistic Updates
```
1. Edit employee position to "Senior Engineer"
2. Observe: Change appears IMMEDIATELY (before save completes)
3. Wait for save to complete
4. Refresh page → Change should persist
5. Simulate error: Disconnect internet, try to edit
6. Observe: Error message appears, data rolls back
```

#### Test 3: Bitrix Sync
```
1. Update employee email in admin UI
2. Open Bitrix24 CRM
3. Find the employee by badge number
4. Verify: Email field updated in Bitrix ✓
5. Check multiple fields (position, phone, subsidiary)
6. Verify: All changes synced to Bitrix ✓
```

#### Test 4: Audit Log
```sql
-- Run this in D1 console to verify audit logging:
SELECT
  bitrix_id,
  action,
  status,
  json_extract(metadata, '$.updatedBy') as updated_by,
  json_extract(metadata, '$.changeCount') as change_count,
  json_extract(metadata, '$.changes') as changes,
  timestamp
FROM audit_logs
WHERE action = 'employee_update'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5;

Expected output:
- changeCount: Number of fields changed
- changes: JSON with before/after values for each field
- updatedBy: Name of admin who made the change
```

#### Test 5: Browser Compatibility
```
Test in multiple browsers:
- ✓ Chrome: Sticky column, validation, date picker
- ✓ Firefox: Sticky column, validation, date picker
- ✓ Safari: Sticky column, validation, date picker
- ✓ Mobile: Responsive design, proper input types
```

#### Test 6: Multiple Field Updates
```
1. Edit employee in admin UI
2. Change email, phone, AND position simultaneously
3. Save changes
4. Verify in Bitrix: All 3 fields updated
5. Check audit log: Single entry with 3 changes in diff
```

#### Test 7: Cache Consistency
```
1. Update employee in admin UI
2. Open employee list in new tab → Changes appear ✓
3. Open employee detail in new tab → Changes appear ✓
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. Refresh all tabs → Data still consistent ✓
```

## 🔐 Security Verification

### Sensitive Field Redaction
```sql
-- Verify SSN is redacted in audit logs:
SELECT
  json_extract(metadata, '$.changes.ufCrm6Ssn.before') as ssn_before,
  json_extract(metadata, '$.changes.ufCrm6Ssn.after') as ssn_after
FROM audit_logs
WHERE json_extract(metadata, '$.changes.ufCrm6Ssn') IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1;

Expected: Both fields show "[REDACTED]"
```

### Validation Security
```
Test that backend rejects invalid data:
1. Use browser dev tools to modify validation
2. Submit invalid email format
3. Expected: Backend returns 400 error with validation details
4. Confirm: Invalid data never reaches Bitrix
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: 404 Not Found on /api/admin/employee/:id

**Symptom**: Frontend shows `GET https://hartzell.work/api/admin/employee/64 404 (Not Found)`

**Root Cause**: Backend was deployed to default environment instead of production environment. Only the production environment has the custom domain routes configured.

**Solution**:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/Agent/Desktop/HR\ Center/cloudflare-app
npx wrangler deploy --env production
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Should return 401 (auth required) not 404 (not found)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://hartzell.work/api/admin/employee/64

# Should return healthy status
curl -s https://hartzell.work/api/health
```

**Key Points**:
- Always deploy to production with `--env production` flag
- Routes are only configured in `[env.production]` section of wrangler.toml
- Default deployment goes to `hartzell-hr-center.agent-b68.workers.dev` (no custom domain)
- Production deployment activates `hartzell.work/api/*` route

## 📞 Support & Monitoring

### Check Logs
```bash
# Backend logs (real-time)
cd /mnt/c/Users/Agent/Desktop/HR\ Center/cloudflare-app
npx wrangler tail

# View recent errors
npx wrangler tail --format pretty | grep -i error
```

### Monitor Audit Logs
```sql
-- Recent employee updates
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE action = 'employee_update'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Failed updates
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE action = 'employee_update' AND status = 'failure'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## ✨ What's Next?

### Recommended Enhancements (Future)
1. **Equipment Management**: Add multi-select for equipment assigned
2. **Document Display**: Show hiring paperwork in Documents tab
3. **Audit History UI**: Display audit log in History tab
4. **Email Notifications**: Send email when employee data changes
5. **Bulk Updates**: Update multiple employees at once
6. **Advanced Search**: Filter employees by department, position, etc.

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Run smoke tests (5 minutes)
2. ✅ Verify Bitrix sync (test 1-2 employees)
3. ✅ Check audit logs (confirm diff tracking)
4. ✅ Test in production with real data
