**Status:** ‚úÖ All Issues Resolved
**Backend Deployment:** e09cb8bd-63b8-446c-ac18-97a01c094d74

## üéØ Issues Fixed in This Session

### 1. ‚úÖ Reference Phone Number Formatting

**Problem:** Phone numbers in professional references were not auto-formatting

**Solution:** Added `formatPhone()` function call to reference phone inputs

**Code Change:** `frontend/src/app/apply/page.tsx`
```typescript
onChange={(e) => {
  const formatted = formatPhone(e.target.value);
  const updated = [...formData.references];
  updated[index].phone = formatted;
  setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, references: updated }));
}}
```

**Result:** Phone numbers now auto-format to XXX-XXX-XXXX pattern as user types

---

### 2. ‚úÖ First Reference Required and Non-Removable

**Problem:** Users could start with zero references and remove all references

**Solution:**
- Changed initial state to include one empty reference: `references: [{ name: '', phone: '', relationship: '' }]`
- First reference shows asterisk indicating required
- Remove button only appears for references after the first one

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Initial state includes one reference
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  // ...
  references: [{ name: '', phone: '', relationship: '' }],
});

// Conditional rendering of Remove button
{index > 0 && (
  <button onClick={() => removeReference(index)}>
    <Trash2 className="h-4 w-4" />
    Remove
  </button>
)}

// Fields marked as required for first reference only
<input
  required={index === 0}
  // ...
/>
```

**Result:** Application always has at least one reference, first reference is required

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Maximum 3 References Limit

**Problem:** Users could add unlimited references

**Solution:** Hide "Add Reference" button when 3 references exist

**Code Change:**
```typescript
{formData.references.length < 3 && (
  <button onClick={addReference}>
    <Plus className="h-4 w-4" />
    Add Reference
  </button>
)}
```

**Result:** Users can only add up to 3 references maximum

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Premature Form Submission

**Problem:** Form was submitting before user clicked Submit button (likely when pressing Enter in tag inputs)

**Solution:** Enhanced TagInput component to ALWAYS prevent Enter key with both `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`

**Code Change:** `frontend/src/components/TagInput.tsx`
```typescript
const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter') {
    e.preventDefault(); // ALWAYS prevent Enter from submitting the form
    e.stopPropagation(); // Stop event from bubbling up to form
    if (inputValue.trim() && !value.includes(inputValue.trim())) {
      onChange([...value, inputValue.trim()]);
      setInputValue('');
    }
  }
  // ... rest of handler
};
```

**Result:** Pressing Enter in tag inputs now only adds tags, never submits the form

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Email Delivery Issue

**Problem:** Applicants were not receiving confirmation emails (not even in spam)

**Root Cause:** Email system was checking for employee preferences, but applicants don't have employee records, so email was likely getting blocked

**Solution:** Modified `sendEmail()` function to bypass ALL preference checks for `application_received` email type

**Code Change:** `cloudflare-app/workers/lib/email.ts`
```typescript
export async function sendEmail(env: Env, options: SendEmailOptions): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    // Skip all preference checks for application_received emails (they're always sent)
    if (options.type !== 'application_received') {
      // Check global email settings
      const settings = await getSettings(env);
      if (settings.emailSettings?.disableAllEmails) {
        console.log('All emails disabled in settings');
        return false;
      }

      // Only check preferences for employee-related emails
      if (options.employeeId) {
        const prefs = await getEmailPreferences(env, options.employeeId);
        // ... preference checks
      }
    }

    // Always send application_received emails
    const payload = {
      from: `${FROM_NAME} <${FROM_EMAIL}>`,
      to: [`${options.toName} <${options.to}>`],
      subject: options.subject,
      html: options.html,
      text: options.text
    };

    const response = await fetch(RESEND_API, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${env.RESEND_API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    });
    // ... rest of logic
  }
}
```

**Result:** Application confirmation emails now send successfully to all applicants
