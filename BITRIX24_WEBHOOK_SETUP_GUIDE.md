## üìä Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### View Webhook Logs

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/Agent/Desktop/HR\ Center/cloudflare-app
wrangler tail --format pretty
```

This shows real-time logs of:
- Webhook calls from Bitrix24
- Email sends
- Any errors

### Check Email Log in Database

```bash
# Query email_log table to see all sent emails
wrangler d1 execute hartzell_hr_prod --command "SELECT * FROM email_log ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10"
```

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Webhook not triggering
**Solution:** Verify the webhook URL is exactly `https://hartzell.work/api/bitrix/stage-change` (no trailing slash)

**Issue:** Email not sending
**Solution:** Check that the candidate has a valid email in `ufCrm6Email` field in Bitrix24

**Issue:** "Employee not found" error
**Solution:** The item ID in Bitrix24 may not exist or may have been deleted. Check the item ID in the webhook payload.
